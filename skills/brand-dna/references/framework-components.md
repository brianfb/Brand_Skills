# Brand DNA Framework — Component Reference

## 1. Purpose

**Definition:** The fundamental reason the brand exists beyond profit. The dent it's trying to make in the world.

**Test:** If this brand disappeared tomorrow, what would the world lose?

**Weak example:** "To provide high-quality products to our customers."
**Strong example:** "To give independent creators the same tools that billion-dollar studios have — so the best ideas win, not the biggest budgets." (Figma-style)

**Common mistakes:**
- Too broad ("to make the world a better place")
- Too functional ("to sell premium coffee")
- Confusing purpose with mission

---

## 2. Vision

**Definition:** The aspirational future state the brand is working toward. A description of the world *after* the brand has succeeded at scale.

**Test:** Is this a future someone would want to fight for?

**Weak example:** "To be the #1 leader in our industry."
**Strong example:** "A world where anyone can build software as easily as they can write a sentence."

**Common mistakes:**
- Making it about market share rather than impact
- Making it too vague to inspire action
- Confusing vision (future state) with mission (present action)

---

## 3. Mission

**Definition:** What the brand does today, for whom, and through what approach. The mission is actionable and present-tense.

**Formula:** We [action] for [audience] by [method/approach].

**Weak example:** "We strive to deliver excellence in everything we do."
**Strong example:** "We build open-source design tools that help small teams ship beautiful products without a dedicated designer."

**Common mistakes:**
- Too abstract to guide daily decisions
- Listing activities instead of impact
- No clear audience

---

## 4. Core Values

**Definition:** 3-5 non-negotiable principles that guide decisions, hiring, culture, and communication. Values should create real constraints — they should make some decisions *harder*.

**Test:** Has this value ever cost you something? If not, it's not a real value.

**Weak set:** Integrity, Innovation, Excellence, Teamwork, Customer Focus
**Strong set:**
- **Default to transparency** — We share the messy middle, not just the highlight reel. Revenue, roadmap, and mistakes are public.
- **Opinionated by default** — We'd rather be wrong and specific than safe and vague. Strong defaults, easy overrides.
- **Finish the thing** — We ship. A live feature beats a perfect spec. We cut scope before we cut deadlines.

**Principles for good values:**
- Each value should have a name + 1-2 sentence description
- They should occasionally conflict with each other (that tension is useful)
- They should disqualify some potential hires (if everyone agrees, it's not a value)
- They should be testable in real decisions

## 5. Brand Personality

**Definition:** The human character traits the brand would have if it were a person. Personality drives *how* the brand shows up, independent of *what* it says.

**Framework options:**

**Archetype model** — Pick a primary and secondary archetype:
- Creator, Explorer, Sage, Hero, Magician, Outlaw, Everyman, Lover, Jester, Caregiver, Ruler, Innocent

**Trait spectrum** — Define where the brand falls on key spectrums:
- Serious ↔ Playful
- Formal ↔ Casual
- Established ↔ Rebellious
- Complex ↔ Simple
- Elite ↔ Accessible

**Personality adjectives** — Pick 3-5 specific adjectives:

**Weak:** Professional, Innovative, Friendly
**Strong:** Witty, Nerdy, Restless, Warm, Blunt

**The "dinner party" test:** If this brand showed up at a dinner party, how would people describe them afterward?

## 6. Brand Voice & Tone

**Definition:** Voice is the consistent personality expressed through language. Tone is how that voice *adapts* to different contexts.

**Voice = constant identity.** Tone = situational adjustment.

**Voice dimensions:**
- **Pace:** Short punchy sentences vs. flowing long-form?
- **Vocabulary:** Technical jargon vs. plain language? Slang vs. formal?
- **Rhetoric:** Questions? Commands? Stories? Data?
- **Humor:** Dry wit? Self-deprecating? Wordplay? None?
- **Point of view:** First person plural ("we")? Second person ("you")? Third person?

**Tone mapping — define tone for each context:**

| Context | Tone adjustment |
|---|---|
| Marketing / homepage | Confident, aspirational |
| Product UI / UX copy | Clear, concise, helpful |
| Error messages | Calm, solution-oriented, human |
| Social media | Casual, personality-forward |
| Support / help docs | Patient, thorough, empathetic |
| Internal / culture | Honest, direct, informal |
| Crisis communication | Transparent, accountable, calm |

**Voice examples** — Always provide 2-3 sample sentences showing the voice in action across contexts.

**Do's and Don'ts list** — Concrete writing guidelines:
- Do: "Use contractions. Sound like a human."
- Don't: "Don't use corporate buzzwords like 'leverage,' 'synergy,' or 'best-in-class.'"

## 7. Positioning

**Definition:** The strategic space the brand occupies in the minds of its target audience, relative to alternatives.

**Components:**

**Target audience:**
- Demographics (age, role, location, income)
- Psychographics (values, behaviors, frustrations, aspirations)
- Jobs-to-be-done (what are they hiring this brand to do?)

**Category:**
The market frame of reference. Sometimes the most powerful move is to *redefine* the category.
- Existing category: "project management software"
- Reframed category: "team alignment platform"

**Differentiation:**
What makes this brand the *only* one that ___? The "only" test forces genuine distinctiveness.

**Positioning statement:**
For [target audience], [Brand] is the [category] that [key benefit] because [reason to believe].

**Weak:** "For businesses, Acme is the platform that helps teams work better."
**Strong:** "For early-stage startup founders who can't afford a design team, Pinta is the brand-in-a-box that generates production-ready visual identity in minutes, powered by AI trained on 50,000 funded startup brands."

**Competitive frame:**
Identify 2-4 alternatives the audience might consider (including "do nothing") and articulate the distinct position vs. each.

## 8. Brand Story

**Definition:** The narrative that gives the brand emotional resonance and memorability. Not a company history — a *story* with narrative structure.

**Story arc:**
1. **The world before** — What was broken, missing, or frustrating?
2. **The inciting moment** — What personal experience or insight sparked the brand?
3. **The struggle** — What obstacles were overcome? What was sacrificed?
4. **The breakthrough** — What changed? What was built?
5. **The vision ahead** — Where is this going? What's the next chapter?

**Rules:**
- Lead with tension, not credentials
- Make the customer the hero, not the founder
- Specificity > grandiosity
- Emotion before information

---

## 9. Visual Identity Direction

**Definition:** Strategic guidance for the visual world of the brand. This is *not* a design spec — it's the creative brief that a designer would use to create the actual visual identity.

**Components:**

- **Color mood:** Emotional direction for the palette (e.g., "warm earth tones that feel handmade" vs. "high-contrast neons that feel digital-native")
- **Typography feel:** The personality of the type (e.g., "geometric sans-serif that feels engineered" vs. "humanist serif that feels literary")
- **Imagery style:** Photography, illustration, iconography direction
- **Spatial design:** Dense and information-rich vs. minimal and spacious
- **Texture and materiality:** Flat and clean vs. textured and tactile
- **Overall mood board description:** 1-2 sentences capturing the complete visual feel

**Reference technique:** Name 2-3 existing brands whose visual *energy* (not specifics) is in the right neighborhood, then describe how this brand would differ.

---

## 10. Tagline / Mantra

**Definition:** A compact, memorable phrase that captures the brand's essence. The tagline is external (marketing). The mantra is internal (team alignment).

**Types:**
- **Descriptive:** Says what you do ("Search the world's information")
- **Aspirational:** Says what you believe ("Think different")
- **Provocative:** Challenges a norm ("Move fast and break things")
- **Imperative:** Commands action ("Just do it")

**Provide 3-5 options** spanning different types so the user can choose.

**Test:** Can someone hear this once and remember it a week later?

---

## 11. Brand Do's and Don'ts

**Definition:** Concrete behavioral guidelines for anyone representing the brand — employees, partners, contractors, AI tools.

**Categories:**
- **Communication:** How we write, speak, present
- **Visual:** How we use logos, colors, imagery
- **Behavioral:** How we act in meetings, on social media, at events
- **Product:** How we build, name, and describe features
- **Partnerships:** Who we align with and who we don't

**Format:** Use specific, actionable statements.
- Do: "End support emails by restating what we'll do next and by when."
- Don't: "Don't use stock photography of people shaking hands."
- Do: "Name features with plain verbs (Share, Export, Connect), not branded nouns."
- Don't: "Don't sponsor events that conflict with our sustainability values."
