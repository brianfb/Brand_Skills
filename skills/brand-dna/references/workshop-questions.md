# Brand DNA Workshop — Question Bank

Use these questions to guide a user through discovering their Brand DNA. Present questions **one section at a time**, 2-4 questions per turn. Synthesize and reflect back before moving to the next section.

---

## Section 1: Purpose & Origin

*Start here. This grounds everything else.*

1. Why did you start this? What problem made you angry, frustrated, or obsessed enough to act?
2. If your brand succeeded beyond your wildest expectations, what would be different about the world?
3. Who were you trying to help when this idea first took shape? Picture a specific person.
4. What would be *lost* if your brand disappeared tomorrow?
5. Finish this sentence: "The world doesn't need another ___. It needs ___."

**Synthesis prompt:** From these answers, draft a Purpose statement and a Vision statement. Reflect them back to the user for validation.

## Section 2: Audience & Problem

*Get specific about who this is for and what they're struggling with.*

1. Describe your ideal customer in detail — not demographics, but their *situation*. What's their day like? What are they struggling with?
2. What have they tried before? Why didn't those solutions work?
3. What do they *say* they want vs. what do they *actually* need?
4. If your ideal customer could wave a magic wand, what would change about their current situation?
5. Who is this brand explicitly *not* for? Who should look at it and think "this isn't for me"?

**Synthesis prompt:** Draft a Target Audience profile with demographics, psychographics, and jobs-to-be-done.

---

## Section 3: Differentiation & Positioning

*Find the white space.*

1. When people find you, what were they looking for? What search terms, recommendations, or situations bring them to you?
2. Name 2-3 alternatives your audience considers (competitors, DIY, doing nothing). What's good and bad about each from the customer's perspective?
3. What do you do that none of them do — or what do you do fundamentally *differently*?
4. If you had to explain what makes you different in one sentence to a stranger at a party, what would you say?
5. What category do you operate in? Is there a better way to describe that category that reframes the conversation in your favor?

**Synthesis prompt:** Draft a Positioning Statement using the formula: For [audience], [Brand] is the [category] that [key benefit] because [reason to believe].

---

## Section 4: Values & Beliefs

*Find the non-negotiables.*

1. What's a decision you've made (or would make) that was *hard* because of what you believe? Something where the easy path conflicted with your principles.
2. What behavior would get someone fired from your team — not the obvious stuff, but something specific to your culture?
3. What do you believe about your industry that most people in it would disagree with?
4. If a journalist wrote a profile of your brand's culture, what would you want the headline to be?
5. Pick the harder side of these tensions:
   - Speed vs. Quality
   - Transparency vs. Privacy
   - Convention vs. Innovation
   - Growth vs. Sustainability
   - Individual vs. Community

**Synthesis prompt:** Draft 3-5 Core Values, each with a name and 1-2 sentence description. Pressure-test: could a real company disagree with these? If not, sharpen them.

---

## Section 5: Personality & Character

*Make the brand human.*

1. If your brand were a person at a party, how would they behave? Are they the loud storyteller, the thoughtful listener, the witty observer, the passionate debater?
2. Pick 5 adjectives that describe your brand's personality. Now eliminate 2 that are too generic.
3. Name a public figure, fictional character, or real person whose *energy* matches your brand. What specifically about their style matches?
4. What should people *feel* after interacting with your brand? (e.g., empowered, calm, amused, challenged, seen)
5. Where does your brand fall on these spectrums?
   - Serious ←→ Playful
   - Elite ←→ Accessible
   - Traditional ←→ Rebellious
   - Simple ←→ Complex
   - Warm ←→ Cool

**Synthesis prompt:** Draft a Brand Personality section with archetype, adjectives, and the "dinner party" description.

## Section 6: Voice & Communication

*Define how the brand speaks.*

1. Read these two sentences and tell me which sounds more like your brand:
   - A: "We leverage cutting-edge technology to deliver best-in-class solutions."
   - B: "We build tools that actually work. No jargon. No bloat."
2. Do you use "we" or "I"? Do you talk *to* customers ("you") or *about* what you do?
3. Is your brand's language more like: a text from a smart friend / a well-written article / an inspiring speech / a sharp tweet?
4. What words or phrases should your brand *never* use? (e.g., corporate buzzwords, competitor terminology, certain slang)
5. Write a fake social media post from your brand. Don't overthink it — just write how you'd naturally talk about what you do.
6. How would your brand deliver bad news? (e.g., a price increase, a feature removal, a delayed launch)

**Synthesis prompt:** Draft a Brand Voice section with voice dimensions, tone mapping across 4-5 contexts, 2-3 example sentences, and a Do's/Don'ts list.

---

## Section 7: Brand Story

*Find the narrative.*

1. What's the origin story? Not the polished version — the real one. What was the moment of "I have to do this"?
2. What was the hardest part of getting started? What did you almost quit over?
3. Is there a pivotal moment — a customer interaction, a failure, a realization — that changed the direction of the brand?
4. What's the *next chapter* of this story? Where are you headed that excites you?
5. If a customer were telling a friend about you, what story would you want them to tell?

**Synthesis prompt:** Draft a Brand Story using the narrative arc: World Before → Inciting Moment → Struggle → Breakthrough → Vision Ahead.

## Section 8: Visual & Sensory Direction

*Note: This is strategic direction, not design spec.*

1. Name 2-3 brands (in any industry) whose *visual feel* resonates with the energy you want. What specifically about their look appeals to you?
2. What colors come to mind when you think about your brand? Not specific hex codes — moods. (e.g., "warm sunset tones," "cool minimal blues," "bold black and neon")
3. Should your brand *look* more: handmade / engineered / organic / digital / vintage / futuristic?
4. If your brand were a physical space, what would it look like? (e.g., a Brooklyn coffee shop / a Tokyo concept store / a Scandinavian cabin / a Miami rooftop)
5. What should your brand *never* look like? What visual styles would feel wrong?

**Synthesis prompt:** Draft a Visual Identity Direction section with color mood, typography feel, imagery style, and overall aesthetic description.

---

## Section 9: Tagline & Synthesis

*Only do this after all other sections are complete.*

1. Look back at everything we've built. What single idea ties it all together?
2. If your brand could put one sentence on a billboard, what would it say?
3. What's the one thing you want someone to remember about your brand 5 minutes after they first encounter it?

**Synthesis prompt:** Generate 3-5 tagline options spanning descriptive, aspirational, and provocative styles. Then compile the complete Brand DNA document.

## Facilitation Notes

**If the user gives short answers:**
- "Can you give me a specific example of that?"
- "Tell me about a time when that actually happened."
- "What would someone who disagrees say?"

**If the user is stuck:**
- Offer two contrasting examples and ask which resonates more
- Ask them to name a brand they admire and explain why
- Reframe the question around a concrete scenario

**If the user wants to skip a section:**
- Mark it as `[REVISIT]` and move on
- Circle back at the end with fresh context from completed sections
- Some sections unlock after others — personality often clarifies voice, positioning often clarifies values

**Pacing:**
- Sections 1-3 (strategic foundation) should take the most time
- Sections 4-6 (expression) often flow quickly once the foundation is set
- Sections 7-9 (narrative and synthesis) are best done in a single focused pass
