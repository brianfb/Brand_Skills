## Generation Guidelines

When generating voice samples:

### 1. Start with the Brand DNA

Pull from these sections:
- **Voice & Tone:** The constant voice characteristics and tone mapping
- **Personality:** The adjectives and archetype inform word choice and rhythm
- **Values:** Should be subtly present in how the brand shows up
- **Positioning:** Particularly for homepage headline and about page

### 2. Apply Context-Specific Tone

Use the tone mapping from Brand Voice & Tone:
- Marketing contexts → confident, aspirational
- Product/UI contexts → clear, concise, helpful
- Error/support contexts → calm, solution-oriented, human
- Social contexts → casual, personality-forward
- Internal contexts → honest, direct, informal

### 3. Maintain Voice Consistency

Even as tone shifts, these should stay constant:
- Vocabulary choices (jargon level, word preferences)
- Sentence rhythm (short/punchy vs. flowing)
- Point of view (we/you/I)
- Humor approach (dry/self-deprecating/none)

### 4. Quality Check Each Sample

For each generated sample, verify:
- [ ] Does this sound like the brand (not generic)?
- [ ] Is the tone appropriate for this context?
- [ ] Would this pass the competitor test (could they say this)?
- [ ] Does it reflect the brand's values?
- [ ] Is it clear and useful for its purpose?

## Output Format

Present voice samples in this format:

```markdown
## Voice Samples: [Brand Name]

Based on your Brand DNA, here's how [Brand Name] sounds across 10 different contexts:

### 1. Homepage Headline
> "[The headline]"

*Why it works:* [1 sentence explaining how this reflects the voice]

### 2. Error Message
> "[The error message]"

*Why it works:* [1 sentence explaining how this reflects the voice]

[... continue for all 10 contexts]

### Voice Principles Demonstrated

These samples show your voice in action:
- **[Voice trait 1]:** [How it showed up across samples]
- **[Voice trait 2]:** [How it showed up across samples]
- **[Voice trait 3]:** [How it showed up across samples]

### Tone Spectrum in Action

Notice how the tone shifts while voice stays constant:
- **Most formal:** [Which sample and why]
- **Most casual:** [Which sample and why]
- **Highest stakes:** [Which sample and why]
```

## Using Voice Samples

After generation, voice samples can be used for:

1. **Onboarding new writers** — Concrete examples of the brand in action
2. **Content review** — Reference point for "does this sound like us?"
3. **Voice validation** — Check if the defined voice actually works in practice
4. **Stakeholder alignment** — Show (not tell) what the brand sounds like
5. **Template starting points** — Adapt these samples for actual use
